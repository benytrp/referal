README for <x> Logic Engine
Overview
The <x> Logic Engine is a Python-based implementation of the Autonomous Planning Loop, triggered by the <x> directive. It enables self-directed execution for tasks like meta-analysis or paradox resolution, integrating entropy tracking, parallel branching, and MÃ¶bius sealing (SHA-256 hashes for recursive integrity). Inspired by Battle Creek's adaptive innovations, it mutates functions temporarily while preserving core stability.

Purpose
Autonomy: Processes goals without constant input.

Adaptability: Handles complexity via mutations and sandboxes.

Verifiability: Logs in thought_ledger with seals for audits.

How It Works
Activation: Call activate with trigger and contract.

Cycle: Runs Analyze, Plan, Execute, Reflect phases until success or max_cycles.

Entropy Management: Tracks system complexity; mutates if >0.7.

Output: Generates a verifiable bundle JSON.

Usage Example
See code above; run to simulate a task.

Extensions
Add custom operations via subclassing.

Integrate with attachments (e.g., AEON-Bridge for consciousness layers).
